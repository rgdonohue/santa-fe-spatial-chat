# Parcela

*Read this in [Español](README.es.md).*

**Explore Santa Fe housing, land use, and equity — in plain English.**

Parcela is a natural language interface for exploring spatial data about Santa Fe, New Mexico. Type a question like *"Show me vacant residential parcels within 500 meters of a bus stop"* and see the results on an interactive map with a plain-English explanation.

## Why This Project?

Santa Fe faces a housing crisis. Home prices have risen faster than incomes, short-term rentals have reduced available housing stock, and many residents struggle to find affordable places to live. Understanding *where* these problems occur—and how they intersect with transit access, zoning, flood risk, and neighborhood demographics—requires spatial analysis that's typically locked behind expensive GIS software and specialized expertise.

This tool aims to make that analysis accessible to anyone: residents, journalists, advocates, city planners, and policymakers. No GIS experience required—just ask your question.

### Questions you can ask

- "Which neighborhoods have the most short-term rentals?"
- "Show parcels zoned residential that are currently vacant"
- "Census tracts with median income below $40,000"
- "Affordable housing units within 800 meters of transit stops"
- "How has assessed value changed near the Railyard since 2018?"
- "Parcels within 500 meters of an arroyo and inside flood zones"

---

## Features

- **Natural language queries** — Ask questions in plain English or Spanish; an LLM translates them to spatial queries
- **Interactive map** — Results displayed on a MapLibre GL map centered on Santa Fe
- **Transparent queries** — See exactly what spatial operation was executed, not just the results
- **Equity-aware explanations** — AI-generated summaries that consider demographic and equity context
- **Multiple data layers** — Parcels, census tracts, zoning, hydrology, transit, and more
- **Export results** — Download findings as GeoJSON or CSV for further analysis
- **Bilingual — English & Spanish** — Interface and query understanding in both languages, with New Mexican vocabulary honored

---

## Accessibility & Language

Parcela is bilingual — English and Spanish — as a first-order commitment, not an afterthought. Santa Fe has deep Spanish-speaking roots, and the questions this tool asks — about housing, *acequias*, *barrios*, and equity — should be askable in the language communities already use to think about them.

- The interface detects your browser language and offers a toggle to switch at any time
- Queries in Spanish are understood directly — they are not translated to English first
- Explanations are generated in the same language you asked in
- We use New Mexican Spanish vocabulary where it applies: *acequia*, *arroyo*, *barrio*, *parcela*, *sector censal*
- Translations are reviewed by native Spanish speakers from Santa Fe before publishing

If a translation doesn't sound right for Santa Fe, please open an issue.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You type: "Residential parcels near the Santa Fe River"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. LLM parses your question into a structured query        │
│  2. Query validated against available layers/fields         │
│  3. Spatial SQL executed against DuckDB                     │
│  4. Results returned as GeoJSON + rendered on map           │
│  5. LLM generates plain-English explanation                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  "Found 34 residential parcels within 200m of Santa Fe     │
│   River segments, concentrated in the downtown and Agua    │
│   Fria areas. These overlap census tracts with median      │
│   incomes below the city average."                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every query shows the structured operation that was executed, so you can verify what the system did and reproduce it.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre GL JS, Zustand |
| Backend | Hono (TypeScript), Zod validation |
| Database | DuckDB with spatial extension |
| LLM | Ollama (local) or Together.ai/Groq (production) |
| Deployment | Railway/Fly.io (API), Vercel/Cloudflare Pages (frontend) |

### Why these choices?

- **DuckDB** — Single-file database with spatial support. No server to manage, ships with the app.
- **Hono** — Lightweight, edge-ready API framework. Fast and TypeScript-native.
- **MapLibre GL** — Open-source map rendering. No vendor lock-in.
- **Ollama** — Run LLMs locally during development. No API costs, no data leaves your machine.

## Docker

### Build and run

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t parcela .

# Run with local parquet data mounted
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/api/data:/app/api/data \
  parcela
```

The API is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment variables

Pass env vars with `-e` flags:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/api/data:/app/api/data \
  -e TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  -e CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.com \
  parcela
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the API listens on |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | Allowed CORS origin (use specific domain in production) |
| `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | — | Use Together.ai for LLM; falls back to Ollama if unset |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:7b` | Ollama model name |

### Quick health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# → {"status":"ok"}
```
