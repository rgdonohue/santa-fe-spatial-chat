## Data Acquisition Notes

### Affordable Housing
**Status:** Requires manual outreach or geocoding

**Option 1: Local Data (Preferred)**
- **Contact:** City of Santa Fe Housing Division or Santa Fe County Housing Authority
- **Phone:** (505) 955-6339 (City Housing)
- **Data needed:** Deed-restricted unit locations, AMI restrictions, expiration dates
- LIHTC-funded projects provide 1,760 units in Santa Fe (40-80% AMI)

**Option 2: HUD LIHTC Database**
- **URL:** https://www.huduser.gov/lihtc/
- **Format:** CSV with addresses (requires geocoding)
- **Limitation:** National database, may not include all local programs

**Option 3: National Housing Preservation Database (NHPD)**
- **URL:** https://preservationdatabase.org/
- **Access:** Registration required for data download
- **Content:** Federally assisted rental housing inventory

### School Zones
**Status:** Requires school district data

- **Issue:** City GIS Layer 22 contains school points only (no attendance zones)
- **Contact:** Santa Fe Public Schools - (505) 467-2000
- **Alternative:** Derive Voronoi/Thiessen polygons from school points
- **Note:** Charter schools may not have defined attendance zones

### Wildfire Risk
**Status:** Raster data available; vectorization needed

**Sources Investigated:**
- **USFS Wildfire Risk to Communities:** https://wildfirerisk.org/download/
  - State-level GIS data via Forest Service Research Data Archive
  - Format: 270m raster (requires vectorization for parcel analysis)
- **NM Wildfire Risk Portal (NMWRAP):** https://nmwrap.org/
  - Contact: nmwrap@edac.unm.edu
- **City WIRE Hub:** https://santafe-wire.hub.arcgis.com/
  - 2006 Community Wildfire Hazard Ratings
  - Contact: pnchavarria@santafenm.gov

**Challenge:** Wildfire risk is typically raster data at 270m resolution. Converting to parcel-level polygons requires:
1. Download state raster from USFS
2. Clip to Santa Fe extent
3. Vectorize or sample to parcel centroids

### Vacancy Status
**Status:** Derived layer (no direct source)

- **Method:** Combine multiple indicators:
  1. Assessor "owner-occupied" flags (from parcel data)
  2. USPS vacancy indicator data (if available via FOIA)
  3. Utility connection status (requires utility company data)
- **Challenge:** Distinguishing seasonal vacancy from long-term vacancy
- **Alternative:** Use building permit activity + ownership transfer records

## Methodology

### CRS Convention
- **geom_4326** (WGS84): Display and topological operations (intersects, contains, within)
- **geom_utm13** (EPSG:32613): Metric operations (distance, buffer, area)

### Data Processing
1. Fetch from ArcGIS REST with pagination (2000 records/request)
2. Convert Web Mercator (3857) → WGS84 (4326)
3. Map source fields to schema-compliant field names
4. Export to GeoParquet with dual geometries
5. Update manifest.json with metadata

### Quality Checks
- Invalid geometry detection and logging
- Null value handling for key fields
- Deduplication where applicable
- Extent validation against expected bounds
